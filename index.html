       <p>Hisham’s Palace, or Qasr Hisham, is an archeological site from the eighth century in the city of Jericho, Palestine.</p> 

       <p>It is an Umayyad castle built during the reign of the Umayyad Caliph Hisham ibn Abdul Malik. The centerpiece of the courtyard is a window of the palace that created a star shape on the floors of the palace when light would come through it. Now, the shape is known as an international symbol for Jericho.</p>

        <p>The site is a major tourist attraction in Palestine, and according to Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, it receives nearly 40,000 visitors yearly.</p>

        <p>In 749 CE an earthquake hit the Jordan Valley and destroyed much of the palace, but the Palestinian Authority has been able to restore the artifacts and areas with international help. The palace boasts some of the world’s largest floor mosaics. One of the most recognizable landmarks in the site is the Tree of Life mosaic which pictures a lion attacking a gazelle.</p>

        <p>With the help of the Japanese International Cooperation Agency, the Palestinian Authority created a canopy spanning 2,500 square meters to protect and preserve the mosaic tiles.</p>

        <p>The canopy was opened to the public in October 2021, after decades of excavations and restoration. One of the world’s largest mosaic tiles lines the floor, covering nearly 9,000 square feet.</p>
